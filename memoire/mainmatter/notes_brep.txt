Boundary representation (B-rep): This represents objects in
terms of their ‘skin’, the boundary between model and non-model.


The method used for representing and manipulating solid models in this book
is the so-called B-rep technique. This technique represents objects in terms of
the ‘skin’ surrounding them. See Braid [10][11], Baumgart [4] or Mantyla [82].

The skin is composed of a set of adjacent bounded surface elements, called
faces. Faces are bounded by sets of edges, which are portions of curves lying
on the surface of the faces on either side of the edge. The points where several
faces meet are called vertices. The boundary representation datastructure will
be described in more detail in chapter 3 and Appendix A.

Boundary techniques can be used to describe both solid models and a vari-
ety of simplified forms that can be termed: “degenerate models”. Extensions
to the datastructure allow special types of models called “non-manifold mod-
els” to be represented that can be used for different purposes.




Boundary representations represent objects in terms of their ‘skin’, the bound-
ary between ‘model’ and ‘non-model’. The skin is divided up into surface
portions or faces. The faces are surrounded by sequences of edges, which are
portions of curves between two adjacent surface portions. Edges, or curve
portions, are delimited by vertices, which are also where several faces meet
(figure 3.1). The datastructure can be divided into two basic groups: one
responsible for defining the structure of the object (the topology) and one the
form or shape of the object (the geometry) (figure 3.2a). The main elements,
mentioned above, are the faces, edges, and vertices, together with their geo-
metric forms: surfaces, curves, and points (figure 3.2b). 
The ‘normal’ datastructure kernel contains other elements, for various purposes (figure 3.2c).
Several additional facilities can be added around this kernel for representing
such things as features and for annotating the model. In addition, it is de-
sirable to include facilities for creating assemblies and for implicitly copying
objects. It can be useful to associate supplementary geometric entities with
models or parts of models for various purposes.

Essentially, a BRep is a graph structure with nodes corresponding to faces, edges and
vertices in a cell decomposition of the solid’s boundary. Links between the nodes express
connectivity information. 
Faces with holes are used by many BRep modelers. They normally are represented by
introducing an additional level in the combinatorial structure between faces and edges.
Edges are grouped into closed circuits or loops, and face nodes point to loop nodes, which
in turn are linked to their associated edge nodes.


Faces and edges are best viewed as representational artifacts that must be carefully defined
by the designers of BRep schemes. First, let us assume that there is a set of primitive surfaces 
(e.g. planes and natural quadrics) for a boundary scheme. 
Then, typical face definitions should satisfy the following conditions:
* 1. A face is a subset of the solid’s topological boundary.
* 2. The union of all the faces equals the boundary of the solid.
* 3. Each face is a subset of only one primitive surface instance.
* 4. A face is homogeneously 2-D, it has no dangling vertices or edges.
* 5. A face is a connected set.
* 6. Faces are quasi-disjoint, i.e., meet only at edges or vertices.
* 7. A face is the largest subset of the boundary that satisfies all the previous conditions

--- repris par Pentcheva (2010) ---
une face est un sous-ensemble bidimensionnel de la frontière du solide qui est homogène
(ne contient pas de sous-ensembles unidimensionnels), fermé, connexe et contenu dans 
un seul carreau de surface.
-----------------------------------

Faces of curved objects involve a representation for a host surface or patch, a set of bounding edges, and neighborhood information. 
Host surface representation involves additional metric information (or “geometry”) beyond vertex coordinates.


Edges also must be defined precisely. Typical BRep schemes use edges that satisfy the following conditions:
* 1. An edge is a subset of a face’s boundary.
* 2. The union of all the edges associated with a face equals the face’s boundary.
* 3. Each edge is a subset of the intersection of two primitive surface instances. (parce que manifold, NDT)
* 4. An edge is a compact, connected 1-manifold. (Some schemes require that an edge be
homeomorphic to a line segment.)
* 5. Edges are quasi-disjoint, i.e., meet only at vertices.
  6. An edge is the largest subset of the boundary of a face that satisfies all the previous
conditions.

--- repris par Pentcheva (2010) ---
une arête est un sous-ensemble unidimensionnel fermé et connexe de l’intersection d’une paire 
de carreaux de surfaces qui appartient au bord d’une face.
-----------------------------------

Normally, edges are parameterized and represented as curves.
Approximations, for example by splines, are often used. This can cause delicate numerical problems, 
because points on the edge do not necessarily lie in the surfaces whose intersection creates the edge. 
Approximate representations in the (u,v) parametric spaces of
the surfaces involved are even more pernicious, because each edge is represented twice,
and the two representations do not coincide exactly.

------------------------- Crozet (2017) -------------------------
The BRep data structure describes the boundary ∂Bk of a body Bk as a 2-manifold CW-complex
which is connected, closed, oriented, without self-intersections. The previous properties define
a volume, which is also commonly called a ‘solid’ in the CAD community. The CW-complex
structure includes three types of entities with a distinction between topological entities 
(vertices, edges, faces with restrictions over their parametric domains) and their
corresponding geometric counterparts (points, curves, and surfaces).

1. Faces correspond to 2-manifold smooth entities. They combine a surface represented as
a mapping σ : R^2 → R^3 with trimming curves that reduces their parametric domain to a
closed proper subset of the 2D plane R^2. Each trimming curve corresponds to an edge of
the BRep model;

2. Edges are 1-manifold entities located at the intersection of exactly two faces. The 2-
manifold structure of the BRep guarantees that two faces cannot intersect without forming
an edge, and three faces cannot meet at a single edge either. Edges are modeled by curves
represented by the mapping α : R → R^3;

3. Vertices are 0-manifold entities located at the intersection of edges. Note that two in-
tersecting edges do so at a vertex only. The geometry of a vertex is a single point of R^3.

"Représentation par les frontières" ou "Modélisation surfacique" (par opposition à CSG en CAD)

BRep consiste à décrire la frontière d'un solide à l'aide d'un complexe cellulaire formé de faces, d'arêtes et de sommets.











CW complexe/complexe cellulaire (de dimension 2): 
	cellules de dimension 0, 1, 2 : sommets, aretes, faces

séparation topologie (structure) / géométrie (forme)
plus entités de groupement (coquilles, contours)
plus entités d'orientation (co-aretes)


face : 2-variété bornée, ouvert (possède au moins un bord, représenté par le "contour extérieur"), connexe mais pas nécessairement homéomorphe à un disque (peut posséder plusieurs bords, ie contenir des trous ou "contours intérieurs") --> géométriquement décrite par un carreau restreint de surface paramétrique (de continuité géométrique élevé, au moins G^1)
dans la présente implémentation, le choix du type paramétrisation implique qu'il n'y a pas de périodicité (cylindres, sphères, cones, ... scindés en plusieurs faces pointant vers le même carreau de surface, mais avec des domaines paramétriques disjoints)

arête : 1-variété bornée, connexe, ouvert (possède deux bords)

sommet : point où deux arêtes adjacentes se rencontrent, et également où plusieurs faces se rencontrent
